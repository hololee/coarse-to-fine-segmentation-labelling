# Datasets:
We created three new datasets to test the proposed technique; the circle, Bean-Field, and Paprika-Disease datasets. Additionally, we also applied the technique to the publicly available CVPPP [40] and CWFID [41] datasets. All images were downsized to 512x512 without regard for aspect ratio.
## 1.	Circle Dataset
To test the proposed method for producing fine labels, basic circular objects with gaussian noise were randomly put on a noisy pallet, as shown in Figure 10. The Circle Dataset had 500 data samples in total. In this case, MGRL had a somewhat wider diameter than their corresponding true circular objects.
## 2.	Bean-Field Dataset
The bean field dataset employs images gathered on a private soybean farm in Gimje, Jeollabuk-do, South Korea. It was filmed from a top-down perspective and consists of a total of 252 photographs. A sample image along with its MGRL is shown in Figure 3 (a). The field was photographed three times per week for five weeks, at the beginning and middle stages of plant development. The photographs were taken in a variety of environmental conditions, including shadow, lightning, rain, and clouds.
## 3.	Paprika-Disease Dataset
Images of paprika leaves infected with three different diseases - blossom-end rot, spotting disease, and gray mold - are included in the dataset. The dataset was collected at the JBARES Paprika Test Site, which is run by the South-Korean Research Development Authority (RDA) and consists of 90 images in total. Figure 3 (b) shows a few sample shots from the dataset, which includes side views of paprika leaves.
